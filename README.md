This Add-On was originally created by Provision aka https://github.com/GuimDev and is updated by Semjon Kerner as member of fishyboteso.
It adds many more states, tighter state changes and a much more stable state machine.
I touched or changed almost all of the code and hence am releasing this as an own addon.
